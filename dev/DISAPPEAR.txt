[CONNOR]

Guys like you and me

We're just the losers

Who keep waiting to be seen, right?

I mean no one seems to care

Or stops to notice that we're there

So we get lost in the in-between


But

If you can somehow keep them thinking of me

And make me more than an abandoned memory

Well that means we matter too

It means someone will see that you are there


No one deserves to be forgotten

No one deserves to fade away

No one should come and go

And have no one know he was ever even here

No one deserves to disappear

To disappear

Disappear



[EVAN, spoken]

It's true.?



[CONNOR]

Even if you've always been that

Barely-in-the-background kind of guy



[EVAN & CONNOR]

You still matter



[CONNOR]

And even if you're somebody who can't escape the feeling

That the world's passed you by



[EVAN]

You still matter



[CONNOR]

If you never get around to doing some remarkable thing

That doesn't mean 



[EVAN]

That doesn't mean

That you're not worth remembering
